The source code of RecyclerView in Android support library is a bit hard for reading:

- It hold almost all code of RecyclerView in a single file, which contains more than 2w line.
- The relation of classes is hard to recognize

So I rearrange the source, splitting the classes into separate files, make it better for code reading.

## License

I just rearrange the source, make almost nothing new to it.

So this project follows the license of Android support library.
